 Send a broadcast on a particular ax25 interfaces - new options 16Oct2024

 Usage : ax bc <iface> [destination call]* [broadcast data]*

  * denotes optional arguments, some examples below :

   ax25 bc ax0         uses ID dest call and preconfigured bctext
   ax25 bc ax0 APN20P  uses an APRS dest call with preconfigured bctext

   This one below uses an APRS dest call and bypasses preconfigured bctext,
   but still supporting recent TAG to inject UTC time. You can use this to
   replace the very limited built in APRS RF beacons as well.

      ax25 bc ax0 APN20P "=4953.22NI09718.35W& #utc utc"

 Note : 'ax25 bcport' and 'ax25 bcinterval' are no longer supported. Instead,
  use 'at' command as your timer, and make use of 'ax25 bc' with new options.
