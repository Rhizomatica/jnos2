Display stations heard on ax25 interfaces, or SET a new heard list for a port

 Usage : ax heard *[ dest | digid | group=<name> ] all | <iface>

         ax heard save | load *[ filename ]

  * denotes an optional single argument, some examples below :

   ax25 h all            traditional syntax, but requires 'all' for ALL ports
   ax25 h digid rp0      NEW show stations heard via a digipeater on port rp0
   ax25 h ax0            traditional syntax, show heard on port ax0
   ax25 h dest all       show destination calls on ALL ports


  ax25 h group=17m rp0  switch to different heardlist for port rp0
    (use group=reset or group=default to return to regular heard list group)

 Note : 'ax25 dest' and 'ax25 hearddest' are no more - use 'ax25 heard' now.
  (the default save or load file is 'AxHeardFile' in JNOS root directory)
